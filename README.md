# Boilerplate for Vanilla JS with Parcel 

Hello, this is my simple boilerplate to build apps/projects with Vanilla JavaScript and Sass, bundled with Parcel and traspiled using Babel. The goal was just to improve my web development workflow. Feel free to use it and remove the sample code if you'd like!

**UPDATE:** The repo has been updated to handle multiple components. 


# Usage

Install dependencies
```
npm install
```
Commands:
Run dev server:
```
npm run dev
```
Build assets for production:
```
npm run build
```

**BONUS:** It comes with a simple landing page out of the box and it's _**Mobile Responsive!**_
